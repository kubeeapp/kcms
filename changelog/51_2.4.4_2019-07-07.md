- Fixed that price data (last price & chart) was not taken from inventory correction bookings, only purchases
- Fixed weekly chores were scheduled on the same day after execution
- Fixed that undone chores were also included in "Last tracked"
- Fixed the date-time-picker width was too narrow sometimes
- Improved that execution dates of "Track date only" chores will never display the time part
- Improved date display for products that never expire (again, there was a display problem after consuming an item on the stock overview page)
