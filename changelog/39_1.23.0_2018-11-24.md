- New feature: "Shopping list to stock workflow"
  - Add a single shopping list item or all at once to stock directly from the shopping list
  - There are new "stock settings" under settings menu in the top right corner
  - You can enable there, that all products which have "Default best before days" set, are added without confirmation in this workflow
  - => This means, you can add the whole shopping list to stock with one click, if you want
- Improved stock handling
  - On consume, a specific stock item can now be picked
  - A stock item can now be marked as "opened" (on the consume page or directly from stock overview, visible in the product card and on the stock overview page)
- New feature: Calendar
  - Shows all upcoming product expirations, due chores, due tasks and due battery charge cycles
- New translation: French (thanks all the translators)
  - As for all languages, a demo is available at: https://fr.demo.grocy.info
- Small other improvements
  - Allow fraction numbers for recipe ingredients when not checked against stock and add an option to not check stock for a recipe position
  - The current time can now be shown in the header (see the settings menu next to the user icon)
- Changed: Docker related things are now in a separate repository: https://github.com/grocy/grocy-docker
