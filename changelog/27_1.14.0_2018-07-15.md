- New feature: **Recipes**
  - Organize a list of products, amounts and a description into recipes and see at a glance if everything needed is in stock or put the missing things with one click on the shopping list
  - Try it live on the demo page: => https://demo.grocy.info/recipes
- Added norwegian translation (thanks @BlizzWave)
  - Demo available at: => https://no.demo.grocy.info
- A lot of small UI improvements
  - Columns in tables can now be reordered
  - Show a calendar on the shopping list page (useful, at least for me)
  - Table column ordering and sorting is now remembered
  - Sidebar collapse state is now remembered
  - Fixed datetimepicker border
  - Keep the parent sidebar menu item expanded if the active page is a sub menu item
- Custom JS/CSS file names have changed [see README](https://github.com/berrnd/grocy#adding-your-own-css-or-js-without-to-have-to-modify-the-application-itself)
