- Fixed the messed up message/toast after consuming a product from the stock overview page
- Fixed that "Track date only" chores were always tracked today, regardless of the given date
- Fixed that the "week costs" were wrong after removing a meal plan entry
- Fixed wrong recipes costs calculation with nested recipes when the base recipe servings are > 1 (also affected the meal plan when adding such a recipe there)
- Fixed consuming recipes did not consume ingredients of the nested recipes
- Improved recipes API - added new endpoints to get stock fulfillment information (thanks @Aerex)
- Improved date display for products that never expires (instead of "2999-12-31" now just "Never" will be shown)
- Improved date display for dates of today and no time (instead of the hours since midnight now just "Today" will be shown)
- Improved shopping list handling
  - Items can now be switched between lists (there is a shopping list dropdown on the item edit page)
  - Items can now be marked as "done" (new check mark button per item, when clicked, the item will be displayed greyed out, when clicked again the item will be displayed normally again)
- Improved that products can now also be consumed as spoiled from the stock overview page (option in the more/context menu per line)
- Added a "consume this recipe"-button to the meal plan (and also a button to consume all recipes for a whole week)
- Added the possibility to undo a task (new button per task, only visible when task is already completed) and also a corresponding API endpoint
- Added a new `config.php` setting `DISABLE_AUTH` to be able to disable authentication / the login screen, defaults to `false`
- Added a new `config.php` setting `CALENDAR_FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK` to be able to change the first day of a week used for calendar views (meal plan for example) in the frontend, defaults to locale default
