- Some small UI fixes & improvements
  - Recipe ingredient notes were not displayed
  - Edit/delete buttons on the equipment page had no icons
  - Improved the overview pages "action buttons column" (e. g. hide more rarely used actions behind a context/dropdown menu)
  - The "purchase to stock conversion factor" is now displayed on the purchase page when QU units are different (above the amount field)
  - Some JS files were not loaded correctly on case sensitive file systems
  - The changelog is now included as markdown files (in `/changelog` directory, one file per release with a filename in format `<ReleaseNumber>_<Version>_<ReleaseDateIso>.md`) and shown in the about dialog
  - Please review your `CURRENCY` setting in `data/config.php`, see also `config-dist.php` - this should be the ISO 4217 code of the currency to properly work with the JS `toLocaleString` function
- New translation: (thanks all the translators)
  - Russian (demo available at https://ru.demo.grocy.info)
