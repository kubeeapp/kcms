- New feature: Tasks / To-do list
- Renamed habits to chores as this is more what it is about
- Products can now be organized in product groups, this group is also used to group the items on the shopping list (you can use this to optimize your way in the supermarket for example)
- Added an option to stay logged in permanently (checkbox on the login page)
- When the database was changed externally, the current page is automatically reloaded when there was no input for at least 50 seconds
- Fixed some minor UI bugs
