- New API method to get a product by its barcode (`/stock/products/by-barcode/{barcode}`, thanks @matejdro)
- The best before date on the purchase and inventory page can now also be today or earlier, but when so, a short hint is displayed
- Fixed some UI bugs
  - When consuming a product with "Allow partial units in stock" enabled from the stock overview page, the displayed amount after the stock booking was wrong
  - The inventory form was not validated with certain click paths
