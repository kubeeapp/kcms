- Fixed that deleting meal plan entries did not work
- Fixed a problem that the user settings were not properly initialized for the frontend JS part when not logged only (so potentially affected only the login page)
- Fixed an issue that the shopping list did not load when a plural translation for a quantity unit was missing
- Fixed that tooltips were visible forever when consuming all products on the stock overview page
- Fixed that login did not work when "Stay logged in permanently" was set and grocy runs on a 32-bit system (thanks @matejdro)
- Fixed page reloads when "Auto reload on external changes" is enabled and there is unsaved form data (the detection did not work for forms in modal dialogs, e. g. when adding a entry to the meal plan)
- Fixed (again) that the product picker did not work properly when the product name contains single quotes
- Fixed that a entered barcode on the product edit page was only saved when "adding" it to the barcodes list by pressing `TAB` (is now automatically added to the list also when just leaving the field)
- Improved that errors/messages from the API are shown properly when undoing a stock booking is not possible (stock journal page)
- Improved night mode CSS (done by @BlizzWave, thanks!)
- A new localization for `en_GB` is now always included - nothing is really translated there, it's only about component "translations" that e. g. the first day of the week is correct for calendars
