- Basic product price tracking (can be entered on purchase, a little price history chart is shown in the product card - right side on purchase/consume/etc. pages)
- Proper pluralization of everything (for quantity units you can enter the plural form in master data)
- On all overview pages the statistics shown in the header are now updated when doing changes directly on the page (e. g. consuming a product)
- Lots of small fixes and improvements (form validation, translations - thanks for keeping the norwegian translation always updated @BlizzWave, other small bugs)
