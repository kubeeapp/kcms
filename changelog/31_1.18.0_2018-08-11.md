- The complete row is now refreshed on changes on all overview pages
- Added a checkbox to set the "never expires date" in best before date inputs (alternative to shortcut "x")
- Recipes can now have arbitrary quantity units and stock is only checked for one unit then (imagine you have sugar in "Packs" in stock but your recipe "Pancakes" needs 200 grams)
- Added a "consume this recipe button" to remove all ingredients of a recipe from stock with one click
- Other small UI changes/improvements
